# Rare Event Sampling

This is the python implementation of [Thomas Prellberg's stochastic sampling functions](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/t.prellberg/papers/pub084pre.pdf). 
The prerequisites modules of the functions are the following:

- numpy as np
- random
- matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- scipy.special as sc

The functions implemented are listed below (in order):

## For 1-dimensional random walks

- simple sampling 
- biased sampling
- uniform sampling
- perm sampling
- blind perm sampling

## For 2-dimensional random walks

- simple self-avoiding walk (SAW) sampling
- rosenbluth sampling
- perm sampling SAW
