# Rare Event Sampling

This is the python implementation of Thomas Prellberg's stochatic sampling functions found and explained in []   
The prerequisites modules of the functions are the following:

- numpy as np
- random
- matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- scipy.special as sc

The the functions implemented are listed, in order, below:

- simple sampling 
- biased sampling
- uniform sampling
- perm sampling (one-dimensional walk)
- simple self-avoiding walk (SAW) sampling
- rosenbluth sampling
- perm sampling SAW
